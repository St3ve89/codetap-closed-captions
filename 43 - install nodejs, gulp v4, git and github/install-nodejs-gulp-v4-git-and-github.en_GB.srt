1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,333
Setup NodeJS, Gulp, Git and GitHub.

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:10,199
Today, we'll install these tools to help us develop quicker.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,333
and be efficient about it

4
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:16,799
This setup is only needed once per computer.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,766
Unless you want to tweak something about it you'll even forget it

6
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:25,766
So make sure to pay a visit back here in case you do so.

7
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,399
With that said, let's get down to it.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,033
Hey! What's up guys. I'm Marian and my passion is to create the web

9
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:37,466
and help you be part of it.

10
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:40,966
If you're new over here, this is CodeTap

11
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:44,999
where you'll learn to code websites like a professional

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,166
with or without any knowledge of coding.
So consider subscribing.

13
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:54,432
Our first step for today is to install NodeJS

14
00:00:54,433 --> 00:01:01,199
NodeJS is the JavaScript engine that runs inside your Google Chrome browser.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,733
By installing it we'll be able to run JavaScript on our system

16
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,366
without the need to be inside a browser.

17
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:13,332
Before we install it let's find out

18
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:18,433
how we can quickly check if we have it installed on our system already

19
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:24,433
To do that I'll want to launch the console
which on Window is

20
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:30,099
the "Command Prompt" or on Linux and Mac is called the "Terminal"

21
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,333
So, to launch the console on Windows I'll hold the "Start" key and press "R"

22
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:41,666
and inside here I'll type: c m d

23
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:45,666
short for command, and hit "enter"

24
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:50,232
over here I'll say:
node -v

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,466
and there are two possible outcomes. If we have node installed

26
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:59,732
we get the version of node, if we don't the system will let us know

27
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:04,633
that it know nothing about this "node" command.

28
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:10,366
 with that said let's go and google 
"nodejs download"

29
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:19,166
We'll follow the nodejs.org/download link

30
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:25,632
and unless you have a specific requirement for a version of node

31
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:29,099
I'll recommend you to go and click the "Current"

32
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,766
and grab the latest and greatest version of NodeJS

33
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:37,532
The one that's appropriate for your operating system.

34
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:43,099
I'll chose the 64 bit version 
msi installer for Windows

35
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,600
I'll download it

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,833
and run the file once the download is finished.

37
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:55,999
I'll click a couple of times next until the install process is finished.

38
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:03,133
I'll quickly close the command line

39
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:08,799
so we can practice opening it again

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,100
once the installer is finished I'll hold the "Start" key and press "R"

41
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,599
I'll type "cmd" and hit "Enter"

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,200
and say "node -v"

43
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,166
and we can see that node is installed and the version of it is 8.2.0

44
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:42,599
On Windows the NodeJS installer also installs for us the Node Package Manager

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,333
which we'll be using a lot in our future projects

46
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:50,166
so to check for the Node Package Manager version

47
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:57,166
let's type:
npm -v

48
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:02,832
and we can see that we have the 5.3.0 version installed

49
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,033
Our second step is to install "Gulp"

50
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:12,099
Gulp will be responsible for watching files, running build processes

51
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,366
like: compressing images, convert "pug" to "HTML",

52
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:24,566
optimize content, refresh our browser automatically when changes occur, 

53
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:29,866
and many other features that we'll see in our next lessons.

54
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:34,999
now let's firstly check if we have "gulp" installed already or not.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to do that we'll type:
gulp -v

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,566
and we get "gulp is not recognized

57
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:49,766
as an internal or external command", which means we don't have installed on our system

58
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:54,532
to install it we'll ask our Node Package Manager

59
00:04:54,533 --> 00:05:01,099
to install gulp globally so it'll be available for all our projects

60
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,700
so "npm i" for install,

61
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,033
space " -g" for global

62
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:14,099
and the name of the package is "gulp-cli"

63
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,700
hyphen c l i

64
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,000
this will grab gulp and install it on our computer

65
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:34,632
once this is finished we can check if gulp is installed on our computer, again

66
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:39,866
gulp -v

67
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:45,032
and we can see that the cli version is 1.2.0

68
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:49,233
and this is the same as gulp version 4

69
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:52,599
Our next step is to install "git".

70
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,966
Git is a version control system.

71
00:05:55,966 --> 00:06:00,266
it allows us to keep track of our changes and our files

72
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:03,999
just like "steps.html" did for us

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
in "coding is for everyone" beginner series.

74
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,933
with the exception that this is a professional tool that almost all developers use

75
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,499
this is just the tip of the iceberg

76
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,100
as git has lots of other features to offer us

77
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,233
like: code reviews, project management, 

78
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:26,066
code hosting and so many more

79
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:30,632
now let's check if we have git installed on our system already

80
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:33,833
to do that we just type: git

81
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:38,166
and we get that Windows does not recognize this

82
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:42,766
so, to install git, let's google it:

83
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:47,366
download git

84
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:55,333
we'll follow the "git-scm.com/downloads" link

85
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,599
and get the appropriate version for your operating system

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,233
I'll chose the Windows one

87
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,400
and save it in my downloads and run the file once it finishes downloading

88
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:18,966
I'll next, next a couple of times

89
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:26,232
and close the command prompt

90
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:29,533
so we can practice opening it again

91
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:36,066
once the installer is finished let's open our command line again

92
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:40,766
hitting "Start" and "R" key

93
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:44,499
I'll type "cmd" and hit "Enter" 

94
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:46,566
and say "git"

95
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,733
this time we get a message

96
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:56,099
with some help information: how to use git

97
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,133
that means we have git installed on our computer

98
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:03,733
Our next step is to create a GitHub account

99
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:09,566
So let's visit GitHub.com

100
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:16,566
I'll encourage you to signup for GitHub and just follow the steps

101
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:23,399
chose the free version as for the moment it's not necessary to have a paid version

102
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:26,699
I already have a GitHub account created

103
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,066
So I will sign in

104
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,200
Once you're signed in to your account

105
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,632
all you need to do is search for "pug starter"

106
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:49,099
p u g s t a r t e r, pug starter

107
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:57,299
and we look a bit down where you see:
marianzburlea/pug-starter

108
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:06,866
alternatively, you can type in after github.com/

109
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:22,600
m a r i a n z b u r l e a / p u g - s t a r t e r,

110
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:27,999
marianzburlea/pug-starter

111
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,400
and I want you to click on this "star" button

112
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,300
so you add this project to your favourites

113
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,366
so next time, instead of searching for it

114
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:42,066
you'll go to the top-right corner and click on your profile icon

115
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:46,399
and choose from the menu "your stars"

116
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,033
and you can find here all your favourite projects

117
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:53,566
and among them it'll be "pug starter"

118
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:59,532
Our last step would be to install a text editor like: Visual Studio Code

119
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,499
If you haven't already installed it

120
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,066
checkout the description of this video below

121
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:10,666
and you'll find out links towards "how to install visual studio code"

122
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,432
or Atom text editor

123
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:18,566
Other editors that I recommend are:
Sublime or Web Storm

124
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:23,366
or any other text editor that you feel comfortable with.

125
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:26,032
That was it for today guys! I'm so excited

126
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:31,399
I'll be waiting for you in our next episode where we'll start to build properly

127
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,100
a professional web site. We'll start recreating our previous project.

128
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,700
If you're new over here I encourage you to subscribe.

129
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,600
Coz' there'll be more great content like this coming up.

130
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,866
So, I'll see you in the next lesson.
