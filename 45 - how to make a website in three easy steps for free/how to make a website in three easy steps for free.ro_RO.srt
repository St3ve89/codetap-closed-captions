00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,833
1, 2, 3 pași simpli despre cum să construiești
un website gratuit.

2
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:11,866
În acest videoclip vă voi arăta cum se crează un website fără să plătiţi un bănuţ
3
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:16,232
Chiar aşa, complet gratuit. Mai multe despre asta în câteva momente!.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,266
Salut baieți și fetelor.

5
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:22,499
Eu sunt Marian iar pasiunea mea este sa creez internetul

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,933
și sa te ajut pe tine sa faci parte din el.

7
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:30,533
Dacă esți nou aici, acesta este CodeTap, locul in care vei dobandi cum să construiești website-uri 

8
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:36,933
să construiești un website de la zero, cu sau fară cunoștințe de programare

9
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,466
Deci consideră să te abonezi.

10
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:42,532
Dacă mă apreciezi, asigură-te ca dai like acestui video.

11
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:45,299
Ți-aș fi cu adevărat recunoscător pentru asta.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,633
Această configurație are nevoie de NodeJS si Gulp pentru a functiona cum trebuie. Dacă nu le ai

13
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:54,466
dă clik pe lista de “instrumente necesare”

14
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:58,699
in link-ul de mai sus sau in descrierea de mai jos si rezolva-le.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,200
Înainte de a incepe cu cei trei pași, hai sa ne uitam la 

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,700
website-ul finalizat pe care suntem pe cale sa il construim.

17
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:15,866
Ok, în partea din stanga avem replica w3schools

18
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:20,732
iar in partea din dreapta avem w3schools.com, website-ul real 

19
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:23,699!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Am creat un menui de navigare similar
We've created a similar top navigation menu

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
meniul de navigare din stânga si partea din centru unde este conținutul

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,766
Am modificat puțin footer-ul pentru un scenariu mai des folosit

22
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:36,599
ce iți v-a beneficia pe termen lung.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,233
putem deasemena naviga de aici către paginile secundare

24
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:46,633
iar după, un nivel mai jos

25
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:49,199
asta e, acum sa revenim la cei trei pași. 

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Vrem să deschidem consola.

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,966
terminalul, "cmd" pentru Windows

28
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:05,666
și hai sa creăm un director folosind "mkdir" command: mkdir

29
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:14,099
și numele directorului, il voi denumii "cool-stuff" și apas "Enter"

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,100
după care vrem să ne mutăm pe acest director numit "cool-stuff"

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,100
folosind "cd cool-stuff"

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,100
odată ce ma tastat suficiente litere pot apăsa "Tab"

33
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,100
pana ajung la directorul corespunzător si apăs "Enter"

34
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,900
In acest director numit "cool-stuff" vom pune toate proiectele noastre viitoare.

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,900
Așa că putem incepe cu primul pas.

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,900
Ne intoarcem la browser si navigam pe github.com

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,066
Am să folosesc "Ctrl și +" de cateva ori

38
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:54,066
Hai să mergem pe profilul tau si sa alegem "stelele tale"

39
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:58,832
Aici caută "pug-starter" și da clic pe el

40
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:02,833
Dacă nu ai "pug-starter" la favorite

41
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,566
Asta este adresa unde il poți găsi 
"https://github.com/marianzburlea/pug-starter"

42
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:12,532
si odată ce vă aflați pe pagina de destinație puteți folosi butonul "star" pentru a-l adăuga la favorite 

43
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:16,533
Deci, poate fi ușor și rapid accesibil mai târziu


44
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:22,866
Următorul pas este să faceți clic pe acest buton verde, "clone or download"

45
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:26,866
urmat de copy to clipboard

46
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:28,732
Odată ce am copiat acest text

47
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:32,499
Să revenim la linia de comandă și să facem primul pas.

48
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,266
Care este: faceți o copie a acestui depozit pe computerul meu de la GitHub

49
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:44,699
git clone, hai să lipim calea și apoi

50
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:53,233
apăsați "spațiu" și dați-i un nume. O voi numi "w3schools-replica"

51
00:03:56,266 --> 00:04:00,266
Acum, să ne schimbăm în noul nostru director

52
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:05,066
Folosind "dir" putem vedea că git a creat pentru noi "w3schools-replica"

53
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:11,266
Deci să spunem "cd w3" și să apăsăm "Tab"

54
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,932
Și apăsați pe "Enter"

55
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:23,399
Aici, dacă spunem "dir", pe Linux și "ls -lah" pe Mac 

56
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,333
pentru a face același lucru cu "dir". Putem vedea că avem o mulțime de fișiere de aici și

57
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:35,966
Dacă spunem "git status"", git ne va da un mesaj care înseamnă că urmărește acest depozit

58
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:43,399
dacă spunem "git remote -v", putem vedea asta

59
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,433
Acest proiect este încă legat de "marianzburlea / pug-starter"

60
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:53,633
așa că vrem să ne deconectăm de acolo și să ne conectăm la proiectul nostru personal

61
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:58,166
În fiecare proiect git păstrează fișierele într-un dosar .git

62
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,599
așa că vrem să îl eliminăm în acest moment

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,666
Așa că pe Linux și Mac vom spune "rm -rf .git"

64
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,366
care va elimina dosarul ".git"

65
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:16,399
Pe Windows vom spune "rd / s / q .git"

66
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,800
care va face exact la fel. Odată ce am eliminat dosarul .git

67
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
if we say "git status" we'll get a fatal error.

68
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,766
which means: "git no longer tracks this project"

69
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:31,399
now let's fix that and go back to GitHub

70
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,433
and click this "+" icon next to your profile

71
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:38,433
and choose "new repository"

72
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:43,566
you should leave as owner your own username, I'll choose "codetapio"

73
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:47,566
and then I'll say "w3schools-replica"

74
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:53,199
The description is optional, feel free to fill in one.

75
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,200
I'll go on and hit this button "Create repository"

76
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,700
And let's pay attention to this part over here with this six lines.

77
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,033
This echo here will create a "README.md" file with this content in it.

78
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:12,033
This is necessary as when you want to initialize a git project

79
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:15,366
you need minimum one file in that project.

80
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:22,399
however if we say "dir" or "ls -lah" on Linux and Mac

81
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,433
we can see that we've got a bunch of files and folders so that's not the case for us

82
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:31,433
we'll skip this line over here and go straight to "git init"

83
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,499
Let's copy it and paste it in our command line and hit "Enter"

84
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,233
Now git has initialized a new repository in this folder.

85
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:43,966
If we say "git status" we no longer get a fatal error.

86
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:47,966
Now we also want to remove the source folder

87
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:52,266
as no examples files are needed because we'll start from scratch.

88
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:56,632
so to do that on Linux and Mac we use:

89
00:06:56,633 --> 00:07:01,899
rm -rf src

90
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:09,733
and on Windows "rd /s /q src"

91
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:15,766
now let's go to the next one which is "git add"

92
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:20,732
and instead of adding the "readme" file we want to add everything

93
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:25,566
so when we say "git add ." it means:

94
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:30,266
add the current directory and everything in it so git can track it.

95
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:37,766
when we say "git status" we can see that the files have gone from red to green

96
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:41,766
which means git has started to track them.

97
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:46,132
Now let's save those changes with a message.

98
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:52,266
we can go for the default one however I recommend you to be a bit more creative

99
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:56,432
"This is my first save

100
00:07:56,433 --> 00:08:03,666
in git which is called a commit

101
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,666
OK

102
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:12,532
The next two lines don't need any change so let's just copy / paste them

103
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,533
and hit "Enter"

104
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:20,533
give it a sec

105
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,133
once it's done if we refresh this page over here

106
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:30,099
we can see that our repository is synced from local to GitHub

107
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,400
Over here is also a commit link

108
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,733
It says: "one commit". If we click on it we can see our save

109
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:42,733
with the commit message.

110
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:48,866
Our next step is to tell node package manager to install dependencies.

111
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:52,866
so let's do that: 
npm i

112
00:08:52,866 --> 00:09:06,166
installing ...

113
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,866
Once the install is finished we can close this one.

114
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:15,999
And let's open a new Visual Studio Code window.

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And add our project to it.

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's add "w3schools-replica"

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,833
and over here, let's recreate our source folder.

118
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:36,466
So we'll name it "src" ... by clicking the new folder icon.

119
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,632
and in this "src" folder

120
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:43,233
let's create an "index.pug" file.

121
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:47,233
So "index.pug"

122
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:56,366
In this file let's do a very basic, minimal html template

123
00:09:56,366 --> 00:10:00,366
so "doctype html"

124
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:07,899
Then we follow it by html, and head, and body

125
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,133
In PUG it's very important to pay attention to spacing

126
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,633
as everything needs to be indented properly

127
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:19,966
so children and parents can know which one is which.

128
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:30,199
So over here let's say in the head:
"title this is my first pug file"

129
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:37,033
and a tag: "h1 Hello from PUG"

130
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:43,399
Let's save this and let's go for the menu: help

131
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,400
and "Keyboard shortcut reference"

132
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,533
Let's bump this a bit.

133
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:53,533
Let's look for "terminal"

134
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:59,733
So over here you have some shortcuts, just find the one for your operating system.

135
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:03,733
For Windows it's: 
Ctrl + '

136
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:07,066
to toggle the command line or the terminal

137
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:11,999
So if I say " Ctrl + ' "

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
it'll toggle the command line

139
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,633
On Mac it's "alt" and some nearby key, I forgot which one it is.

140
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:25,633
anyway, once we've got the command line opened

141
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:29,633
our first step it to say: npm start

142
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:41,433
and it'll open the browser with our HTML page

143
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:45,433
Let's split this screen and play a bit with it.

144
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:51,166
... weird alien noise ... OK, so this should look fine.

145
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:56,266
now, every time we save this index.pug file

146
00:11:56,266 --> 00:12:00,266
gulp will watch the pug file being saved

147
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:05,666
and compile it in the temporary folder in its corresponding index.html

148
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:10,399
let's open both of those ones. I'll click the split window button over here.

149
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,566
and then I'll go on the left side and choose to split them horizontally

150
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:22,266
so I'll have the index file, index.pug file over here

151
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:25,332
and the index.html file over here opened.

152
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,833
Once I make any change over here

153
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:34,566
watch what happens. So I make a change and then save it.

154
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:40,299
when I save it this dot ("circle") will dissapear over there, it'll convert, sorry

155
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,900
it'll convert into a cross.

156
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,900
Once I saved this file, gulp compiled PUG into HTML

157
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,433
the HTML file has been updated and at the same time the browser has been refreshed.

158
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:59,499
Let's do it one more time: "let's ... do ... it ... one ... more ... time"

159
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,500
This time I'll choose file and save. Once I click save.

160
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,800
Watch over here what happens, and then over here, and then over here.

161
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,800
So: file, save.

162
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,533
See? index.pug has been converted into HTML

163
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:20,366
by the gulp process that watched that file

164
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,166
also the browser has been refreshed.

165
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:26,999
You'd be quick to notice that in pug we no longer have to have

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,600
opening and closing brackets and opening and closing tags

167
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,833
we just type the tag name followed by a space and then the contents of it

168
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,366
more about pug coming up.

169
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:44,099
and if you want to skip ahead and become more comfortable with pug

170
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,966
just go and Google: pug language

171
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:52,099
then head on over to pugjs.org

172
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,366
and read a bit of the documentation over here.

173
00:13:57,366 --> 00:14:06,132
You'd find more example on what you'd write in Pug and what you'd get in HTML

174
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,833


175
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,833
so this is the end of part one 

176
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:18,633
where we’ve discovered how to start a website from scratch, for free in three easy steps

177
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:22,866
In part two we’ll create our landing page and style it

178
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:26,866


179
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,999
Make sure to follow CodeTap on YouTube and FaceBook.

180
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,866
Other two resources that I really recommend are:

181
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:38,866
W3schools.com, where you can literally start from scratch 

182
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:44,866
and discover more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so many more

183
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:48,866
another one that goes hand in hand with w3schools

184
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:54,099
is Free Code Camp where you can put in practice your new skills and test them

185
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,100
You can go on FaceBook and seach:
Free Code Camp

186
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,666
and join the world wide community or one that's closer to you.

187
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,699
I really like the challenges on free code camp

188
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:11,000
as they will prepare you and are really close to future real world client requirements.

189
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,533
Thanks for watching this video.
You've been really amazin.

190
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:20,533
One of the most powerful tools to help you understand the world of coding

191
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:23,633
is to leverage the power of a community

192
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:26,499
and you can do that by leaving comments

193
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,700
so go on and leave a comment right now.

194
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,200
Be as descriptive as possible as help is on the way.

195
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,433

196
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:41,099
